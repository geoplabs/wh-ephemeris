# Engine Layer Implementation Review

This document evaluates whether the requested engine-layer upgrades have been implemented in the current codebase.

## Archetype Engine (`src/content/archetype_router.py`)

* The rule matrix is now expressed through a `Rule` dataclass with scoring weights, intensity biasing, and tag aggregation. Multiple rules can match the same event; their weights are tallied to pick the final archetype instead of exiting on the first hit. Tone votes are also accumulated before selecting a tone tag.
* The matcher supports richer taxonomy hooks such as `house_family`, benefic/malefic flags, focus-area routing, and natal/transit body filters. Rules cover dignity-style modifiers by factoring benefic/malefic checks and house families.
* Intensity is calculated from the raw score and then adjusted by the cumulative `intensity_bias` from all matched rules, providing a combined-read perspective.

Overall, the archetype engine reflects the requested taxonomy growth and multi-rule aggregation strategy.

## Area Routing Engine (`src/content/area_selector.py`)

* Events are first enriched via `annotate_events`, which embeds archetype classifications and gathers scoring sources from houses, fallback houses, focus labels, bodies, and tags.
* Area-specific candidate scorers translate those sources into weighted relevance, combine them with aspect-weighted strength, and boost coherence when the archetype tags align with the area focus.
* Rankings keep more than one candidate per area, sort by blended score, and provide structured summaries that include both primary and supporting events. Fallback logic “borrows” candidates from adjacent houses rather than duplicating a single event everywhere.

These updates meet the brief of dedicated scorers, stackable weights, multi-event support, and smarter fallbacks.

## Narrative Engine (`api/services/option_b_cleaner/*.py`, `data/phrasebank/phrases.json`)

* `language.py` replaces rigid sentence pairs with modular builders that assemble openers, evidence clauses, coaching beats, and closers. Helpers such as `_compose_paragraph` accept multiple evidence sentences, and `_event_evidence_sentences` weaves supporting events into narrative clauses.
* Paragraph builders (`build_career_paragraph`, `build_love_paragraph`, etc.) leverage `MiniTemplate` storylets that deterministically render whichever template requirements are satisfied, mixing tone-specific openings with optional closing clauses.
* `event_tokens.py` sanitizes event descriptors, exposes reusable `MiniTemplate` definitions, and allows several templates (including custom `extra_templates`) to contribute phrases for primary and supporting events.
* The phrasebank expands into variation groups with permutation/choice/subset mechanics, giving the language layer a richer storylet palette.

Taken together, the narrative layer aligns with the requested modular storylet architecture and supports referencing both primary and secondary events within the copy.

## Conclusion

Across all three layers, the implemented code matches the requested enhancements and appears production-ready for the described scenarios.
