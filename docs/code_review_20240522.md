# Code Review Summary

## Overview
I reviewed the current `work` branch focusing on the recent fixes around CORS configuration, ayanamsha handling, and the Panchang horas payload. Below are the main issues I spotted along with suggested follow-up actions.

## Findings

### 1. Development environment is treated as production for CORS
The CORS setup tries to detect development mode with `os.getenv("APP_ENV", "development").lower() == "dev"`. Because the default value is the full string `"development"`, a local environment without `APP_ENV=dev` set will incorrectly go down the production branch and block requests from `http://localhost`. I recommend normalizing to accept both `"dev"` and `"development"`, or defaulting to development behaviour when `APP_ENV` is missing.【F:api/app.py†L29-L60】

### 2. Duplicate ephemeris helpers cause confusion and possible drift
`api/services/ephem.py` still contains the deterministic "mock" helpers (lines 12-49) alongside the real Swiss Ephemeris implementation (lines 95-123). The second `positions_ecliptic` definition overrides the first one at import time, but the leftover code redefines `to_jd_utc` with a different signature and keeps stale constants such as `EPHEMERIS_BACKEND`. This duplication makes the module harder to reason about and risks callers importing the wrong helper from earlier in the file. Consider removing the stubbed implementation or splitting mocks into a dedicated module that tests can import explicitly.【F:api/services/ephem.py†L12-L123】

### 3. Panchang horas summaries only expose a truncated preview in notes
The `_build_notes` helper limits hora information in the textual notes to the first three entries (plus an ellipsis), even when the structured `horas` payload is requested. If downstream consumers still rely on the notes for backwards compatibility, they will miss 21 of the 24 hourly rulers. We should either append the full list to notes when `include_hora` is true or clearly communicate that clients must migrate to the structured `horas` field.【F:api/services/orchestrators/panchang_full.py†L608-L652】

## Suggested Next Steps
1. Update the CORS environment detection to recognise both `dev` and `development` values.
2. Refactor `api/services/ephem.py` to keep a single, authoritative set of helpers and move any mocks/test shims elsewhere.
3. Decide whether legacy consumers still expect full hora text in notes; if so, extend `_build_notes`, otherwise document the change so clients can switch to the structured `horas` array.

Let me know if you'd like me to follow up on any of these fixes.
