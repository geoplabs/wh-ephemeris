# Editorial guidelines for factual inserts

## Purpose

Daily guidance copy can now weave in specific transit details through
sanitized descriptors (for example `{transit_body}`, `{natal_house_label}`,
`{aspect_family}`). These inserts are sourced from the `safe_event_tokens`
whitelist and rendered through mini-templates that automatically drop
segments when the underlying data is missing.

## Voice and tense

* Always write in second-person present tense ("You steady", "You protect").
* Maintain declarative sentences; avoid questions or speculative language.
* Event clauses should stay grounded in observable facts ("Saturn presses on
  your Sun") rather than promises or deterministic claims.

## Integrating factual inserts

* Connect the factual clause with temporal bridges such as "while" or "as"
  so the insert feels anchored to the paragraph's action.
* Use sanitized descriptors only; if a field is absent the template will
  automatically omit the clause.
* Favor concise constructions—one clause per sentence—to keep cadence steady.

## Compliance boundaries

* Never prescribe medical, legal, or financial outcomes; limit inserts to
  contextual cues (e.g., "Mars influence" rather than "Mars guarantees").
* Do not imply certainty or inevitability—frame influences as supportive or
  challenging currents the reader can work with.
* Avoid sensitive health language beyond general wellness habits.
