## What Was Improved

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Storylets - Added Placeholders to All Closers**

**File**: `data/phrasebank/storylets.json`  
**Changed**: 30 generic closers ‚Üí 30 dynamic closers

**Before** (Static, repetitive):
```
"Keep trusting the rituals that already work."
"Let steady choices show you the path forward."
"Protect your bandwidth so pressure can't run the day."
```

**After** (Dynamic, context-aware):
```
"Keep trusting the {descriptor} rituals that support your {focus}."
"Let {descriptor} choices guide your {focus} forward."
"Protect your {descriptor} bandwidth so {focus} pressure stays manageable."
```

**Impact**: Closers now adapt to the daily astrological context instead of repeating the same static text.
